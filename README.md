# FinBank SecurePay 💸🔐  
A DevSecOps-Driven CI/CD Pipeline for Secure Financial Transactions

## 🚀 Project Overview

**FinBank SecurePay** is a production-grade DevSecOps project designed to simulate how a real bank might secure and automate deployments for its payment gateway APIs. The focus here is on integrating security into every phase of CI/CD without slowing down delivery speed.

This project was built from scratch using modern DevOps and security tools like:
- **GitHub Actions** (CI/CD)
- **Terraform** (Infrastructure as Code)
- **Snyk, Trivy, and Dependabot** (Security Scanning & Dependency Management)
- **AWS CLI** (for deployment hooks)

> Think of this as a real-world template for how startups and fintech companies can build secure, automated delivery pipelines from day one.

✅ **CI/CD with GitHub Actions**  
- Push-to-deploy setup with multi-stage pipelines (build → scan → deploy)  
- Secrets managed via GitHub repo secrets

✅ **Security Built-In**  
- Snyk: Scans for known vulnerabilities in dependencies  
- Trivy: Container vulnerability scanning  
- Dependabot: Auto PRs for outdated packages  

✅ **Infrastructure via Terraform**  
- Reproducible infra definitions (VPC, EC2, IAM roles)  
- Version-controlled and modular

✅ **Dev-Friendly Structure**  
- Simple `myapp/` directory for API code  
- `terraform/` folder for infra-as-code  
- `.github/workflows/` contains full CI/CD pipeline
